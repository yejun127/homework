                <h3 style="font-style: normal">Pronounce with me  ---------  /jedʒu:n/</h3>
                  <p>In 2017, I graduated from New York University with a Bachelor degree in Art History and Quantitative Economics. Having worked at a number of art scenes ranging from Gagosian to Artnet, I decided to shift my career from advocating for the voice of artists to advocating for the voice of users. My interest in HCI is a natural collision between my analytical skills and my aesthetic sense. </p>

                  <p>Currently I'm studying for my Master’s in Information Management and Systems (MIMS) with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction at UC Berkeley School of Information. While I am passionate about how technology can help solve problems for people, I am particularly interested in defining problems, and translating the understanding about people's thoughts, emotions, behavior into the design of effective digital interaction. I hope to bridge the gap between human and technology by applying user-centered perspective and ultimately craft experience that truly connects with people. </p>

                  <p>As an enthusiastic world wanderer, I have traveled to 23 countries🌍 in the world and learned 4 languages. I also enjoy gallery hopping🎨, food hunting🍕, photography📷, flower arrangement💐 and have a deep love for puppies🐶. </p>
